If you're looking at this, you probably want to know how to use this code. First, please note:

This code was used on the following hardware:
  + marionette:
    - RC Car: Redcat Everest
    - NodeMCU (model 12E)
    - H-Bridge
    - Power Bank (any with 2 USBs should work)
    - breadboard x2
  + wheatly-on-wheels:
    - Raspberry Pi 0 W
    - PI camera
  + puppeteer:
    - Windows, Linux computers that run python 3

Here's the following code destinations:
  + puppeteer:
    - computer of your choice
    - Use pip3 to install:
      - matplotlib
      - numpy
      - pynput
      - any other missing module when:
            `python3 KeyboardSentry.py`
          is run.
  + wheatley-on-wheels:
    - Raspberry Pi 0 W
  + marionette:
    - NodeMCU. PlatformIO was used
    
    
The Raspberry Pi 0 W also has the following tutorials running on it:
1. Setting up a Raspberry Pi headless.
2. Raspberry Pi access point (change eth0 to wlan1)
